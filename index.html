      <h1>Welcome to Nocturnal&rsquo;s site!</h1>
      <p>Hello! Thanks for stopping by. I&rsquo;m Nocturnal, a software developer of some competence. I have a real name, of course, but after seeing how one of the communities I work in under my real name recently destroyed a fellow developer over petty drama crap, I&rsquo;m trying to use this pseudonym for more and more things online. Too many people have a real problem learning <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+7%3A53-8%3A11&version=NABRE">not to cast the first stone.</a></p>
      <p>My Nocturnal alias is most active as a Swift developer, particularly in regards to the <a href="http://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a> web development framework. My open source work has particularly focused on improving its multi-lingual capabilities; see my <a href="https://github.com/NocturnalSolutions/Kitura-LanguageNegotiation">Kitura Language Negotiation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NocturnalSolutions/Kitura-Translation">Kitura Translation</a> projects, for example. I&rsquo;m also in the process of writing <a href="https://nocturnalsolutions.gitbooks.io/kitura-book/content/">Kitura Until Dawn</a>, a free textbook targeted towards helping Swift coders learn Kitura.</p>
      <p>Under my real name, I primarily have worked with PHP projects. I sure like Kitura and Swift a lot better, though.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a thirty-something man, married with children, living in the USA. Hobbies (outside of software development) include video games, cryptocurrency and related nonsense, and the food, culture, history, and language of East Asia (but especially the food).</p>
